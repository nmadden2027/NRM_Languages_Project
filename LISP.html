            <h2> When was LISP created and by whom?</h2>
                <p>Created in <strong>1960</strong> by <strong>John McCarthy</strong> while he was at MIT.</p>
            <h2>How has LISP evolved since it was created?</h2>
                <p>The language was designed for easy manipulation of data strings and is dynamically typed. Lisp has become a common langauge for artificial intelligence (AI) due to it's ability to compute with symbolic expressions rather than numbers. Some of the languages advantages are it's access to powerful and easy-to-integrate macros, operates on most platforms, faster with smaller code footprints, and the language itself is programmable to meet nearly any need.</p>
            <h2>Is LISP still used today?</h2>
                <p>Yes LISP is still used today although it's not the most popular compared to language like Python. It is still used for things such as AI aling with machine learning, quantum computing, and even basic programming. One of LISP's dialects LISP Clojure still gets used by companies such as Amazon, Capital One, and Walmart. </p>
